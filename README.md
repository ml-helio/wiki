### Tutorials
[Here are the slides](https://zenodo.org/record/3724703) from the second tutorial on machine learning, which covered these topics: 
* Resources for machine learning in heliophysics and astrophysics
* Open source software for machine learning, parallel computing, and heliophysics, and 
* Best practices for scientific reproducibility (how to publish research code and how to publish open source software).
